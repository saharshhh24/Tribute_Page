            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span>B</span>al Keshav Thackeray; (23 January 1926 â€“ 17 November 2012) also known as Balasaheb Thackeray, was an Indian politician who founded the Shiv Sena, a right-wing pro-Marathi and Hindu nationalist party active mainly in the state of Maharashtra.
                Thackeray began his professional career as a cartoonist with the English-language daily, The Free Press Journal in Bombay, but he left the paper in 1960 to form his own political weekly, Marmik. His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, a leading figure in the Samyukta Maharashtra (United Maharashtra) movement, which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state for Marathi speakers. Through Marmik, Bal Thackeray campaigned against the growing influence of non-Marathis in Mumbai.</p>

                        <h4>Personal life</h4>
                        <p>Thackeray was married to Meena Thackeray on 13 June 1948 and had three sons, oldest son Bindumadhav, middle son Jaidev, and youngest son Uddhav. Meena died in 1995 and Bindumadhav died the following year in a car accident. Bal was the eldest of eight siblings, three among them being brothers Shrikant Thackeray (father of Raj Thackeray) and Ramesh Thackeray, and five sisters (Sanjeevani Karandikar, Prabhavati (Pama) Tipnis, Malati (Sudha) Sule, Sarla Gadkari and Susheela Gupte).
                            Raj is his brother Shrikant's son. Despite Raj's breakaway from the main party, Raj continues to maintain that Thackeray was his ideologue and relations between them improved during Thackeray's final years. Raj broke away from Shiv Sena to form his own political party called the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena. 
                            Sanjeevani Karandikar is Bal Thackeray's sister. 
                            Thackeray drew cartoons for the Free Press Journal, the Times of India and Marmik besides contributing to Saamna till 2012. He cited the New Zealander cartoonist David Low as his inspiration.

                        <h5>Career</h5>
                        <p>Thackeray began his career as a cartoonist in the Free Press Journal in Mumbai. His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of The Times of India. After Thackeray's differences with the Free Press Journal, he and four or five people, including politician George Fernandes, left the paper and started their own daily, News Day. The paper survived for one or two months. In 1960, he launched the cartoon weekly Marmik with his brother Srikant. It focused on issues of common "Marathi Manoos" (Marathi, or Marathi-speaking, people) including unemployment, immigration and the retrenchment of Marathi workers. Its office in Ranade Road became the rallying point for Marathi youth. Bal Thackeray later stated that it was "not just a cartoon weekly but also the prime reason for the birth and growth of the Sena". It was the issue of Marmik on 5 June 1966 which first announced the launch of membership for the Shiv Sena.

                        <h5>Death and Legacy</h5>
                        <p>Balasaheb Thackeray, the founder of Shiv Sena, faced death with a profound acceptance, viewing it as a natural part of life's journey. Beyond political power, his legacy was rooted in the pursuit of positive change, making Shiv Sena not just a party but an emotional force.</p>
                        <p>His fearless leadership and unwavering commitment left an indelible mark on Maharashtra's political landscape, inspiring generations to come. Balasaheb's enduring impact lies not only in his contributions but in the spirit of transformation and resilience he instilled, making him a revered figure in the hearts of the people he served.</p>

                                        <p class="description">Thackeray's legacy remains a subject of debate. His supporters hail him as a champion of Marathi pride, a defender of Hindu interests, and a strong leader who challenged the status quo. Critics, however, point to his divisive rhetoric, anti-immigrant stance, and alleged role in inciting violence, particularly during the Ayodhya riots. Thackeray's legacy reflects the complex and often contradictory nature of Indian politics, where regionalism, religious identity, and social tensions play a significant role.
